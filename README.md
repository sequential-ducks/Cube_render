# OpenGL Cube Rendering Project  

This project features a 3D cube with a duck texture applied to its surface.  

## Learning outcomes:
- **3D Cube Rendering**: Learned how to render a cube. Learned about depth buffering, and dynamic transformations for spin effect.  
- **Texturing**: The cube is textured with a linear mix of a duck image and a metallic surface image. Learned to mix textures.
- **3D Perspective Projection**: Learned about cameras, projection and different spaces (eg. model space, view space)

## Demo  
Here is a video showcasing the application in action:
